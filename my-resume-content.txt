Client/Product: Cardlytics, Atlanta, GA 					         April 2019 – Present
Role: Senior Software Engineer 

What Cardlytics does: Cardlytics partners with major banks to analyze anonymized transaction data and understand how people spend. Using these insights, Cardlytics helps advertisers and brands target the right audiences by showing personalized cash-back offers directly inside banking apps. This creates a win-win-win — banks engage their customers better, brands increase their sales, and users get rewarded with cash back for purchases they already make
Tech Stack Used:
Full Stack Development: .NET Core, C#, .NET Web APIs, Worker Services, Kafka, MongoDB, SQL Server, Redis, Ping, React, Vue, Hot Chocolate GraphQL
DevOps & Cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, AWS, TeamCity, Octopus, Sumo Logic, Datadog
Data Engineering: Scala, Spark, Apache Hudi, Apache Airflow, EMR Cluster, AWS Glue Jobs.

Key Contributions:
Developed scalable microservices using .NET Core, Scala, Java,  Kafka, MongoDB, and Redis, enabling real-time reward decisioning and high availability.
Delivered full-stack features integrating Vue/React frontends with GraphQL and REST APIs for internal platforms.
Led design and development of backend services and data pipelines processing 10M+ financial transactions daily, achieving end-to-end transaction ingestion to reward generation within 5 hours.
Designed and optimized Apache Spark pipelines on AWS EMR and Glue, improving performance by 40% and reducing cloud costs by $8K/month.
Implemented cost-optimized infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS, improving deployment efficiency and scalability.
Mentored junior engineers, led technical design sessions, and conducted POCs to validate architectural approaches and tools.
Partnered with product owners to translate business needs into technical user stories, identify requirement gaps, and define implementation strategies.
Contributed to core architecture, module scaffolding, and “happy path” flows to accelerate onboarding and delivery for new projects.

Notable Projects:
Core Data Platform & Rewards Management System:
The Core Data platform is a collection of data pipelines and processes that import, clean, and process data from Banks and Advertisers.
Working experience on Scala, Spark, Apache Hudi, Apache Airflow, EMR cluster, and AWS Glue Jobs to process heavy volumes of transactional data.
Process millions of transactions daily in near real-time to make decisions on reward redemptions for eligible transactions.
Generate various forms of reports for the advertiser to measure the campaign's success.

Measurement (Partner Services):
Partner services enable the system to create and manage cookies and tags installed on Advertisers' and banks' sites, tracking conversions, and facilitating audience generation and reporting.
It also supports and manages third-party tags from other ad ecosystem organizations
This system is a purely microservices-oriented, event-driven architecture deployed on AWS Cloud and Kubernetes Clusters.

Purchase Graph
Purchase Graph is a knowledge graph of Categories, Merchants, and Store Locations (and their Geography) where money can be spent. Allows custom groupings/tagging of the transaction data.
Merchant Location Cleaning is a process that cleans transactions down to the store location level, dramatically improving efficiency and accuracy by relying on the acquiring ID passed to us with the transaction data from major Banks.
The process of merchant cleaning involves matching payment transaction data to the correct advertiser. Daily, Cardlytics receives millions of real-world transactions from financial institutions (FIs). The Merchant Cleaning Team (MCT) uses these strings to identify where those transactions originated from.
